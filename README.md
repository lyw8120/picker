All the programs were complied by GCC 4.9.2 in Linux (kernel version 3.16.0-6).
# picker
A c++ GUI program for helical symmetry determination.
 
# unStack
The purpose is to split a stack of images to a set of single images.
 
# waveLength
It calculates the wavelength for given voltage
 
# padding
It can pad the volume with desired size.
 
# mrcFloat2Char
It is useful when you just want to check the image with proper contrast since it reduces the size of image.

# mrcInfo
mrc file header information will be printed by this program.

# mrc4MLmask
It would generate the mask file which also is a mrc format work with Picker.

# helixSymCal
A helical symmetry calculator after you know the information of the basic vectors.

# mrc2tif
A program converts mrc format to tif format for displaying.

# mrc2png
A program converts mrc format to png format. 

# searchHelicalSymmetry
It targets the local search on the helical symmetry.

# imposeHelicalSymmetry
This program aims to impose the helical symmetry to the volume.

# mrcMath
mrcMath can process the mrc data from 1D to 3D using the basic math operations: +, -, .*, ./. * and / wil come soon.

# frameDose
A small program to give the electron dose per frame for the cryo-em data.

# mrcReference
This program can generate a noise model or solid model(mask) from 1D to 3D. model can be box, sphere or clyinder. Therefore, The deNovoMask, volRef, volMask, and noise programs were removed.

# mrc2smv
mrc2smv can convert the mrc file to SMV(Super Marty View) file format which is commonly used in crystallography.
